# Introduction

If youâ€™re a Gitcoin Passport user interested in setting up a Passport and connecting Stamps to it, head to our [support site](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/what-is-gitcoin-passport) for more info.

## What is Passport?

Passport is a tool that allows users to present evidence that they are real, unique humans and signal their trustworthiness to apps. It is a way to collect and present data without exposing it or giving up ownership. 

Under the hood, it is a unique decentralized identifier (a DID) associated with your Ethereum address, stored on the Ceramic network. 

The DID can be used to look up a user's Stamp data, which exists as a collection of Verified Credentials.

**Verified Credentials do not contain any personal identifying information!** They simply demonstrate, using a cryptographic signature, that the user gave access to a specific app and that some criteria were met.

## Use cases

Developers can integrate Passport in a variety of different programs and apps in the web3 ecosystem, as demonstrated by the following use case examples:

- Sybil resistance for faucets, bundlers and airdrops
- Gating access to content, events, polls, or communities
- Priority weighting votes
- Proving trustworthiness

Passport is a versatile and valuable tool for managing access, promoting transparency, and establishing trust within different web3 environments.

## Available developer tools

Passport score and Stamp data can be retrieved in two ways:

* **Passport API:** Retrieves data associated with a specific address from the Gitcoin server. 
* **Passport Smart Contracts:** Interacts with a blockchain to retrieve data associated with a specific address. 

### Passport API

The Passport API serves as a powerful tool for developers, offering access to Passport scores and Stamps via several REST endpoints.

### Smart contracts

Passport's smart contracts enable you to pull score and Stamp data directly from the blockchain to enable a truly decentralized integration.

### GTC Staking endpoint

Passport's GTC staking endpoint enables developers to analyze and build with GTC staking data.

With this endpoint, developers should build solutions that help increase the amount of GTC staked on trusted entities, effectively growing the GTC trust graph.
