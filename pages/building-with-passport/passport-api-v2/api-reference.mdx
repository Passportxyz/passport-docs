# Passport API v2 -- API Reference

The Passport API enables developers to retrieve Passport XYZ scores and Stamp metadata for users who have created a Passport.

You can also experiment with the Passport API using our [API playground tool](https://api.scorer.gitcoin.co/docs) and adding your API keys via the 'Authorize' button.

<Callout type="info">
**Please note:**<br /><br />Passport API v2 both simplifies and adds key functionality that wasn't previously available with [Passport API v1](../passport-api/overview). Because of this, it is recommended for you to use Passport API v2 moving forward.<br /><br />We have not announced any deprecation or retirement timelines for v1 yet, but plan to provide more details before the end of 2024.
</Callout>

In the examples below, replace the following placeholder values with your actual data:
- `{scorer_id}` - Your Scorer ID from the developer portal
- `{address}` - The Ethereum address you want to score
- `{API_key}` - Your API key from the developer portal


## Authentication

To access the Passport API, you will need a [Scorer ID and an API key](getting-access).

To make a successful request, you will need to include your API key in the "Authorization" header of each API request. The header should have the following format:

```
"X-API-KEY: {API_key}"
```

Replace `{API_key}` with your API key. For example, if you were using cURL, your request might look something like this:

```bash
curl --request GET 'https://api.passport.xyz/v2/stamps/{scorer_id}/score/{address}' \
    --header 'X-API-KEY: VwUi___.0yQU1HIAE4hLEMkVs___'
```

## Rate limits

Your API key will allow you to make up to a certain number of requests to any of the endpoints included on this page during a certain period of time.

Requests made to the Passport API v1 and v2 count towards the same rate limit.

Access starts with Tier 1. If you need an elevation, please [request higher rate limits](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUATg0nTE9ws3qESGBktFcOX0brF19iv2L0BLoiub9pbSMeg/viewform).

| Tier   | Rate limit                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Tier 1 | 125 requests per 15 minutes   |
| Tier 2 | 350 requests per 15 minutes   |
| Tier 3 | 2000 requests per 15 minutes  |
| Tier 4 | 2000+ requests per 15 minutes |


## Key concepts

There are several key concepts you should be aware of when using the Passport API:

* **Timeouts:** The Passport API endpoints have a timeout of 60 seconds. This means that if a request to one of these endpoints does not receive a response within 60 seconds, the request will be aborted. If your request times out, you should set up retry logic by calling the API again after a short delay, typically increasing the delay for each subsequent retry.
* **Pagination:** Some requests return a large amount of data. To effectively retrieve this data, you will need to paginate the response. For more information, see [API pagination](/building-with-passport/major-concepts/api-pagination).

## Available endpoints

Passport API v2 base URL: https://api.passport.xyz

To get a Passport score from an ETH address, follow these steps:

* [Retrieve latest score for a single address](#retrieve-latest-score-for-a-single-address)
