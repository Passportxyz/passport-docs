# Data dictionary (v2)

On this page you will find definitions and explanations for the data types used in the Passport XYZ stack. The `Scorer`, `Stamp` , `Credential` and `Stamp-metadata` objects require the most explanation so they are handled separately here.

### The Scorer object

| Value                  | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | How to use                                                                                                                                          |

| `address`              | `string`          | The `string` of 20 bytes that uniquely identify an Ethereum account                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Identifies a specific account to which the payload's data relates.                                                                                  |
| `score`                | `string`          | The `registry/score` endpoint returns a `string` that should be parsed as a `float`. It represents the result of adding the weights of all a user's Stamps.                                                                                                                                                                                      | If you'd like to use your own [score threshold](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds.mdx), you can compare this score against that threshold to identify which users should be provided access.       |
| `passing_score`        | `string`          | Passing score will return either `true` or `false` as its value, depending on whether the user's score exceeded the `threshold` score of `20`, as recommended by the Passport team. You can also choose your own [score threshold](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds.mdx) and use the `score` value if you'd prefer.                          | If you'd like to use the Passport recommended score threshold, you can use this value to identify which users should be provided access.            |
| `last_score_timestamp` | `datetime string` | The date and time of the request.<br />ISO 8601, `"2023-04-28T09:35:49.159Z"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Can be used to identify when the snapshot of this data occured.                                                                                     |
| `expiration_timestamp` | `datetime string` | The date and time that the next Stamp will expire, which will subsequently reduce the `score`. To see when each specific Stamp expires, please use the [GET /v2/stamps\{address\}](api-reference#retrieve-stamps-verified-by-a-single-address) endpoint.<br />ISO 8601, `"2023-04-28T09:35:49.159Z"`                                             | You might want to display this score expiration to the user to remind them to return to the Passport app to refresh their score before it expires   |
| `threshold`            | `string`          | The Passport recommended score threshold that the user's score must exceed to be considered passing. The current recommended threshold is `20`. You can also choose your own [score threshold](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds.mdx) and use the `score` value if you'd prefer.                                                              | If you'd like to use the Passport recommended score threshold, you can use this value to identify which users should be provided access.            |
| `error`                | `string`          | Describes any error returned by the server. Refer to the API [status and error codes page](status-and-error-codes) for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Can be used to understand why a request failed.                                                                                                     |
| `stamp_scores`         | `struct`          | Contains key:value pairs with Stamp names as keys and their weights for the scoring algoithm as values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Can be used to understand how the score was calculated.                                                                                             |
